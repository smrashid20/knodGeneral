**Patch Explanation: Fixing a Vulnerability in Encryption Initialization**

The proposed patch aims to address a vulnerability in the encryption initialization process. The issue arises when the encryption implementation (tmpImpl) is set to a value greater than 1. In this scenario, the current code does not properly handle the encryption initialization, leading to a potential security risk.

**Step 1: Identify the Vulnerability**
The bug is identified in the encryption initialization process when the tmpImpl value exceeds 1. This specific condition is not handled correctly, resulting in a vulnerability.

**Step 2: Analyze the Current Code**
The current code checks if the encryption implementation has been initialized (cipher.hasEncryptInit()) and throws an exception if it hasn't. However, this check is insufficient when tmpImpl is greater than 1, as it does not account for the specific requirements of this implementation.

**Step 3: Introduce a New Condition**
The proposed patch introduces a new condition to check if tmpImpl is greater than 1. This condition will be used to determine the correct course of action for encryption initialization.

**Step 4: Modify the Encryption Initialization Process**
When tmpImpl is greater than 1, the patch will modify the encryption initialization process to ensure that it is handled correctly. This will involve additional checks and potentially different initialization steps to address the vulnerability.

**Step 5: Ensure Backward Compatibility**
The patch will ensure that the existing encryption initialization process remains unchanged for tmpImpl values less than or equal to 1. This will maintain backward compatibility and prevent any disruptions to existing functionality.

**Step 6: Verify the Fix**
The patch will be thoroughly tested to verify that the vulnerability has been successfully addressed. This will involve testing various scenarios, including different tmpImpl values, to ensure that the encryption initialization process is secure and functions as expected.

By introducing a new condition to check for tmpImpl values greater than 1, the proposed patch provides a comprehensive solution to the identified vulnerability. The modified encryption initialization process will ensure that the system is secure and functions correctly, even in scenarios where tmpImpl exceeds 1.
