The proposed patch aims to address a vulnerability in the existing code by introducing a crucial check to prevent potential security issues. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the changes made in the patch:

1. **Initial Assessment**: The patch begins by evaluating the return value of the `X509PolicyChecker.X509_PCY_TREE_INVALID` check. This assessment determines whether the certificate chain is invalid due to policy constraints.

2. **Certificate Chain Iteration**: If the certificate chain is deemed invalid, the patch iterates through each certificate in the chain, starting from the second certificate (index 1). This iteration is necessary to inspect each certificate individually.

3. **Certificate Validation**: For each certificate, the patch checks two conditions:
   - **Certificate Existence**: It verifies that the certificate is not null, ensuring that a valid certificate object exists.
   - **Policy Extension Flag**: It checks the certificate's hash code to see if the `EXFLAG_INVALID_POLICY` flag is set. This flag indicates whether the certificate has an invalid policy extension.

4. **Error Handling**: If either of the conditions in step 3 fails, the patch triggers an error callback (`cbFailIf`) with relevant parameters, including the certificate, its index in the chain, and a specific error code (`X509Error.X509_V_ERR_INVALID_POLICY_EXTENSION`). This error handling mechanism ensures that any issues with the certificate chain are properly reported and handled.

5. **Return Statement**: After iterating through the entire certificate chain and performing the necessary checks, the patch returns a value of 1, indicating that the function has completed its execution.

However, the proposed patch provided is empty, which means it does not actually implement these steps. To effectively address the vulnerability, the patch should include the necessary code to perform these checks and handle any errors that may occur.
