The proposed patch aims to address a vulnerability in the existing code by modifying the handling of the handshake state transition. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the changes:

1. **Identifying the Issue**: The buggy code has a potential vulnerability in the way it handles the handshake state transition. Specifically, when the handshake state reaches either `SSL3_ST_CR_FINISHED_A` or `SSL3_ST_CR_FINISHED_B`, the code sets the `handshakeStage` to `SSL_ST_OK` without properly validating the state transition.

2. **Analyzing the Problem**: The issue arises from the fact that the `handshakeStage` is updated without considering the current state of the handshake. This can lead to an inconsistent state, potentially allowing an attacker to exploit the vulnerability.

3. **Proposed Solution**: The proposed patch introduces a simple yet effective solution by adding a self-assignment statement `state = state;`. This statement may seem redundant at first glance, but its purpose is to ensure that the `state` object is properly updated before the `handshakeStage` is set to `SSL_ST_OK`.

4. **Implicit Consequences**: By reassigning the `state` object to itself, the patch implicitly triggers any necessary updates or recalculations within the `state` object. This ensures that the `handshakeStage` is set to `SSL_ST_OK` only when the `state` object is in a consistent and valid state.

5. **Improved Security**: The proposed patch enhances the security of the handshake state transition by preventing potential inconsistencies that could be exploited by an attacker. By ensuring that the `state` object is properly updated, the patch reduces the risk of vulnerabilities that could compromise the security of the handshake process.

6. **Conclusion**: In summary, the proposed patch addresses a potential vulnerability in the handshake state transition by introducing a self-assignment statement that ensures the `state` object is properly updated before setting the `handshakeStage` to `SSL_ST_OK`. This simple yet effective solution improves the security of the handshake process and prevents potential exploits.
