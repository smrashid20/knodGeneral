**Patch Explanation: Fixing a DNS Vulnerability**

The proposed patch aims to address a vulnerability in the DNS (Domain Name System) code. The issue arises when handling DNS queries, specifically when the result of a query is not successful. In such cases, the code checks if a DLZ (Dynamically Loaded Zones) search has been performed. If it has, the code calls the `dlzAllowZonexfr` function to determine if a zone transfer is allowed.

However, the current implementation has a flaw. It only checks if the `dlz_searched` list is empty, but it does not verify if the query class matches the expected value. This oversight can lead to a vulnerability, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive DNS data.

To fix this issue, the proposed patch introduces an additional check to ensure that the query class matches the expected value. This is achieved by comparing the `result` variable with the `questionClass` variable.

Here are the steps taken in the proposed patch:

1. **Identify the vulnerability**: The patch identifies the vulnerability in the DNS code, specifically in the handling of unsuccessful query results.
2. **Analyze the root cause**: The root cause of the vulnerability is determined to be the lack of verification of the query class.
3. **Introduce a new check**: The patch introduces a new check to verify that the query class matches the expected value.
4. **Compare result with questionClass**: The `result` variable is compared with the `questionClass` variable to ensure they match.
5. **Enhance security**: By adding this additional check, the patch enhances the security of the DNS code, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.

The proposed patch is a crucial fix to address the identified vulnerability, ensuring the DNS code is more secure and resilient to potential attacks. By introducing a simple yet effective check, the patch prevents malicious actors from exploiting the vulnerability, thereby protecting sensitive DNS data.
