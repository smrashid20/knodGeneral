The vulnerability in the wolfSSL library occurs when a TLS 1.3 client does not receive a Pre-Shared Key (PSK) extension or a Key Share Extension (KSE) from a malicious server. In this scenario, the client uses a default, predictable buffer for the Input Key Material (IKM) value when generating the session master secret. This compromises the security of the session master secret key, allowing an eavesdropper to potentially reconstruct it and access or manipulate the session contents.

The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the fact that the client does not properly handle the absence of a PSK or KSE extension from the server. When the client does not receive these extensions, it should not proceed with the default IKM value. Instead, it should terminate the connection or request the necessary extensions from the server.

The repair addresses this vulnerability by adding a check to ensure that either a PSK has been negotiated or a Key Share Extension is present before proceeding with the TLS 1.3 handshake. Specifically, the repair adds a conditional statement that checks if the `pskNegotiated` option is false and the `namedGroup` is zero. If both conditions are true, the function returns an error code `EXT_MISSING`, indicating that a required extension is missing.

This repair ensures that the client does not proceed with a vulnerable default IKM value when the server does not provide the necessary extensions. By terminating the connection or requesting the required extensions, the client prevents the use of a predictable IKM value and mitigates the risk of an insecure TLS 1.3 session. This fix is essential for maintaining the security and integrity of TLS 1.3 connections, especially in scenarios where the client does not control both sides of the connection.
