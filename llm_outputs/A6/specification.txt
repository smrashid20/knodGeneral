AEAD_CHACHA20_POLY1305 is an authenticated encryption with additional data algorithm. The inputs to AEAD_CHACHA20_POLY1305 are:

- A 256-bit key
- A 96-bit nonce — different for each invocation with the same key
- An arbitrary length plaintext
- Arbitrary length additional authenticated data (AAD)

The ChaCha20 and Poly1305 primitives are combined into an AEAD that takes a 256-bit key and 96-bit nonce as follows:

- First, a Poly1305 one-time key is generated from the 256-bit key and nonce using the procedure described in Section 2.6.
- Next, the ChaCha20 encryption function is called to encrypt the plaintext, using the same key and nonce, and with the initial counter set to 1.
- Finally, the Poly1305 function is called with the Poly1305 key calculated above, and a message constructed as a concatenation of the following:
  - The AAD
  - padding1 — the padding is up to 15 zero bytes, and it brings the total length so far to an integral multiple of 16. If the length of the AAD was already an integral multiple of 16 bytes, this field is zero-length.
  - The ciphertext
  - padding2 — the padding is up to 15 zero bytes, and it brings the total length so far to an integral multiple of 16. If the length of the ciphertext was already an integral multiple of 16 bytes, this field is zero-length.
  - The length of the additional data in octets (as a 64-bit little-endian integer).
  - The length of the ciphertext in octets (as a 64-bit little-endian integer).
