To repair the vulnerability, several steps need to be taken. 

First, after the SASL feature has been successfully received, the code checks if a secure connection has already been established. This is necessary because the features are parsed a second time after TLS is established, and we want to avoid unnecessary disconnections.

Next, the code checks the security mode configuration. If the security mode is set to "required" and a secure connection has not been established, it means that the server does not offer TLS, which is a requirement for secure communication.

In this case, the code initiates a shutdown of the connection to the server. This is a security measure to prevent any further communication over an insecure connection.

Finally, the code throws a SecurityRequiredByClientException. This exception indicates that the client requires a secure connection, but the server does not provide one. By throwing this exception, the code ensures that the client is aware of the security risk and can take appropriate action.

By adding these checks and taking the necessary actions, the repair ensures that the client is protected from man-in-the-middle attacks and that TLS protections are not bypassed. The client will only proceed with the connection if a secure connection is established, and will otherwise disconnect and throw an exception.
