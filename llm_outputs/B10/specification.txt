The Initialization Vector (IV) SHOULD be chosen at random, and MUST be unpredictable. Note that in versions of TLS prior to 1.1, there was no IV field, and the last ciphertext block of the previous record (the "CBC residue") was used as the IV. This was changed to prevent the attacks described in \[CBCATT]. For block ciphers, the IV length is of length SecurityParameters.record\_iv\_length, which is equal to the SecurityParameters.block\_size.
