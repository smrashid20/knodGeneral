An OCSP request contains the following data:

- Protocol version
- Service request
- Target certificate identifier
- Optional extensions, which may be processed by the OCSP responder

Upon receipt of a request, an OCSP responder determines if:

1. The message is well formed
2. The responder is configured to provide the requested service
3. The request contains the information needed by the responder

If any one of these conditions is not met, the OCSP responder produces an error message; otherwise, it returns a definitive response.
