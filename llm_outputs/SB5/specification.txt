signatureAlgorithm
The signatureAlgorithm field contains the identifier for the cryptographic algorithm used by the CA to sign this certificate. \[RFC3279], \[RFC4055], and \[RFC4491] list supported signature algorithms, but other signature algorithms MAY also be supported.

An algorithm identifier is defined by the following ASN.1 structure:
AlgorithmIdentifier ::= SEQUENCE {
algorithm OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
parameters ANY DEFINED BY algorithm OPTIONAL }

The algorithm identifier is used to identify a cryptographic algorithm. The OBJECT IDENTIFIER component identifies the algorithm (such as DSA with SHA-1). The contents of the optional parameters field will vary according to the algorithm identified.

This field MUST contain the same algorithm identifier as the signature field in the sequence tbsCertificate (Section 4.1.2.3).

signatureValue
The signatureValue field contains a digital signature computed upon the ASN.1 DER encoded tbsCertificate. The ASN.1 DER encoded tbsCertificate is used as the input to the signature function. This signature value is encoded as a BIT STRING and included in the signature field. The details of this process are specified for each of the algorithms listed in \[RFC3279], \[RFC4055], and \[RFC4491].

By generating this signature, a CA certifies the validity of the information in the tbsCertificate field. In particular, the CA certifies the binding between the public key material and the subject of the certificate.
