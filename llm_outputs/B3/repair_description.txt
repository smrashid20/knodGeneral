To repair the vulnerability in the client-side SSH code, the following steps were taken:

1. **Identification of the vulnerability**: The first step was to understand the nature of the vulnerability, which was a non-RFC-compliant check of the available authentication methods. This allowed an SSH server to manipulate the login process and bypass additional security measures.

2. **Analysis of the buggy code**: The buggy code was analyzed to determine the root cause of the vulnerability. It was found that the code did not properly check for trivial authentication methods, which could be exploited by an attacker.

3. **Introduction of a new check**: To address the vulnerability, a new check was introduced to ensure that trivial authentication methods are not allowed when the `disable_trivial_auth` option is enabled. This check is performed before setting the `authdone` flag.

4. **Implementation of the check**: The new check was implemented by adding a conditional statement that checks the value of `cli_opts.disable_trivial_auth` and `cli_ses.is_trivial_auth`. If trivial authentication is not allowed and the current authentication method is trivial, the program exits with an error message.

5. **Verification of the fix**: The repaired code was verified to ensure that it correctly handles the authentication process and prevents the exploitation of the vulnerability. The new check was tested to ensure that it properly blocks trivial authentication methods when the `disable_trivial_auth` option is enabled.

6. **Integration with existing code**: The repaired code was integrated with the existing codebase, ensuring that it does not introduce any new bugs or affect the functionality of other parts of the program.

7. **Testing and validation**: The repaired code was thoroughly tested and validated to ensure that it works as expected and does not introduce any new vulnerabilities. The testing included scenarios where trivial authentication methods are allowed and disallowed, as well as cases where the `disable_trivial_auth` option is enabled and disabled.

By following these steps, the vulnerability in the client-side SSH code was successfully repaired, and the security of the program was improved by preventing the exploitation of trivial authentication methods.
