[RFC5281], Section 7.6 permits "authentication of the client via client certificate during phase 1, with no additional authentication or information exchange required." This practice is forbidden when EAP-TTLS is used with TLS 1.3. If there is a requirement to use client certificates with no inner tunnel methods, then EAP-TLS should be used instead of EAP-TTLS.
The use of client certificates is still permitted when using EAP-TTLS with TLS 1.3. However, if the client certificate is accepted, then the EAP peer MUST proceed with additional authentication of Phase 2, as per [RFC5281], Section 7.2. If there is no Phase 2 data, then the EAP server MUST reject the session.

As with EAP-TTLS, [PEAP] permits the use of client certificates in addition to inner tunnel methods. The practice of using client certificates with no "inner method" is forbidden when PEAP is used with TLS 1.3. If there is a requirement to use client certificates with no inner tunnel methods, then EAP-TLS should be used instead of PEAP.
The use of client certificates is still permitted when using PEAP with TLS 1.3. However, if the client certificate is accepted, then the EAP peer MUST proceed with additional authentication of the inner tunnel. If there is no inner tunnel authentication data, then the EAP server MUST reject the session.
