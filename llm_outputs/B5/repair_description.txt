The repair steps for the given vulnerability involve validating the signature algorithms when importing a certificate. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the repair:

1. **Initial Certificate Decoding**: The first step is to decode the certificate using the `asn1_der_decoding` function. This step remains the same as in the buggy code.

2. **Extracting Signature Algorithm**: After successful decoding, the next step is to extract the signature algorithm from the certificate. This is done using the `_gnutls_x509_get_signature_algorithm` function, which retrieves the signature algorithm from the "signatureAlgorithm.algorithm" field of the certificate.

3. **Extracting TBS Signature Algorithm**: In addition to the signature algorithm, the repair code also extracts the signature algorithm from the "tbsCertificate.signature.algorithm" field of the certificate. This is done using the same `_gnutls_x509_get_signature_algorithm` function.

4. **Comparing Signature Algorithms**: The extracted signature algorithms from steps 2 and 3 are then compared to ensure they match. If the algorithms do not match, an error message is logged, and the function returns an error code.

5. **Proceeding with Certificate Processing**: If the signature algorithms match, the function proceeds with processing the certificate. This includes extracting the raw issuer distinguished name (DN) from the "tbsCertificate.issuer.rdnSequence" field of the certificate using the `_gnutls_x509_get_raw_field2` function.

6. **Error Handling**: Throughout the repair steps, error handling is performed using the `gnutls_assert` function, which checks for errors and returns an error code if any issues are encountered.

By adding the steps to extract and compare the signature algorithms, the repair code ensures that the signature algorithms match when importing a certificate, thus addressing the vulnerability.
