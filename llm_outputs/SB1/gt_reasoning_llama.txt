The vulnerability in question allows remote attackers to obtain unauthorized access to a server by exploiting a flaw in the ssl3_get_cert_verify function. This function is responsible for verifying the authenticity of a client's certificate during the TLS handshake protocol. Specifically, the issue arises when the server is configured to recognize a Certification Authority that supports Diffie-Hellman (DH) certificates.

The problem lies in the fact that the ssl3_get_cert_verify function does not properly enforce the requirement for a CertificateVerify message when a DH certificate is used for client authentication. This message is essential for verifying the client's private key, which is necessary for secure authentication. Without this verification, an attacker can craft malicious TLS handshake traffic to trick the server into accepting their authentication request, even if they do not possess the required private key.

The buggy code snippet reveals the root cause of the issue. It checks if the message type is not a CertificateVerify message and, if so, it sets the reuse_message flag to 1. However, it only sends an alert and returns an error if the peer is not null and the message type is a signed packet (EVP_PKT_SIGN). This condition is not sufficient to prevent the vulnerability, as it does not account for the specific case of DH certificates.

The repair addresses this issue by removing the unnecessary condition that checks for EVP_PKT_SIGN. Now, if the peer is not null, the function will always send an alert and return an error if the message type is not a CertificateVerify message. This ensures that the server will properly enforce the requirement for a CertificateVerify message, even when a DH certificate is used for client authentication.

In essence, the repair strengthens the authentication process by making sure that the server verifies the client's private key, regardless of the type of certificate used. This prevents attackers from exploiting the vulnerability and gaining unauthorized access to the server.
