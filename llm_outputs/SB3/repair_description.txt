The repair of the vulnerability involves several steps to ensure that the client-side SSH code complies with RFC standards and prevents an SSH server from manipulating the login process. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1. **Identify the vulnerability**: The first step is to understand the vulnerability, which lies in the non-RFC-compliant check of available authentication methods. This allows an SSH server to bypass additional security measures, such as FIDO2 tokens or SSH-Askpass.

2. **Determine the fix**: To fix this vulnerability, the code needs to check if trivial authentication is allowed when the `msg_userauth_success` message is received. Trivial authentication is a simple authentication method that can be easily bypassed by an attacker.

3. **Add a conditional check**: The repair involves adding a conditional check to verify if trivial authentication is disabled in the client options (`cli_opts.disable_trivial_auth`) and if the current authentication method is trivial (`cli_ses.is_trivial_auth`). This check ensures that the client does not proceed with the authentication process if trivial authentication is not allowed.

4. **Throw an exception for non-compliant authentication**: If the conditional check fails, the code throws an `IllegalStateException` with a message indicating that trivial authentication is not allowed. This prevents the client from proceeding with the authentication process and ensures that the vulnerability is not exploited.

5. **Proceed with the original authentication process**: If the conditional check passes, the code proceeds with the original authentication process, setting the `authdone` flag to `true`, updating the client session state, and cleaning up any public key authentication data.

By adding this conditional check, the repaired code ensures that the client-side SSH code complies with RFC standards and prevents an SSH server from manipulating the login process. This fix prevents an attacker from abusing a forwarded agent to log on to another server unnoticed, thereby enhancing the security of the SSH connection.
