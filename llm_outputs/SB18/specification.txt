The AlgorithmIdentifier parameters field is OPTIONAL. Implementations MUST accept SHA2 AlgorithmIdentifiers with absent parameters. Implementations MUST accept SHA2 AlgorithmIdentifiers with NULL parameters. Implementations MUST generate SHA2 AlgorithmIdentifiers with absent parameters.

NOTE: There are two possible encodings for the AlgorithmIdentifier parameters field associated with these object identifiers. The two alternatives arise from the loss of the OPTIONAL associated with the algorithm identifier parameters when the 1988 syntax for AlgorithmIdentifier was translated into the 1997 syntax. Later, the OPTIONAL was recovered via a defect report, but by then many people thought that algorithm parameters were mandatory. Because of this history, some implementations encode parameters as a NULL element while others omit them entirely. The correct encoding is to omit the parameters field; however, when some uses of these algorithms were defined, it was done using the NULL parameters rather than absent parameters. For example, PKCS#1 \[RFC3447] requires that the padding used for RSA signatures (EMSA-PKCS1-v1\_5) MUST use SHA2 AlgorithmIdentifiers with NULL parameters (to clarify, the requirement "MUST generate SHA2 AlgorithmIdentifiers with absent parameters" in the previous paragraph does not apply to this padding).
