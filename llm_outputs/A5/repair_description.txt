The repair steps for the given vulnerability involve modifying the `OCSP_basic_verify` function to correctly handle certificate verification failures when the `OCSP_NOCHECKS` flag is used. Here are the steps to repair the vulnerability:

1. **Identify the Issue**: The first step is to understand the problem. The `OCSP_basic_verify` function is not correctly handling certificate verification failures when the `OCSP_NOCHECKS` flag is used. Instead of returning a fatal error, it returns a positive value indicating a successful verification.

2. **Locate the Problematic Code**: The next step is to locate the code that is causing the issue. In this case, it is the code block that checks the return value of the verification function and raises an error if it is less than or equal to zero.

3. **Determine the Correct Behavior**: The correct behavior for the `OCSP_basic_verify` function is to return a negative value indicating a fatal error when the certificate verification fails, even if the `OCSP_NOCHECKS` flag is used.

4. **Modify the Error Handling**: The error handling code needs to be modified to correctly handle the case where the verification fails. Instead of raising an error and continuing, the function should return a negative value indicating a fatal error.

5. **Preserve Error Information**: The error information should be preserved so that it can be used to diagnose the issue. This includes the error code and the error string.

6. **Test the Repaired Code**: Once the code has been modified, it should be thoroughly tested to ensure that it correctly handles certificate verification failures, even when the `OCSP_NOCHECKS` flag is used.

7. **Verify the Fix**: The final step is to verify that the fix has resolved the issue. This can be done by testing the `OCSP_basic_verify` function with different inputs and verifying that it returns the correct results.

By following these steps, the vulnerability in the `OCSP_basic_verify` function can be repaired, ensuring that it correctly handles certificate verification failures and returns the expected results.
