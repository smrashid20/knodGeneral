The repair steps for the vulnerability in the PJSIP code involve a crucial modification to prevent the incorrect switching from SRTP (Secure Real-time Transport Protocol) to RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) upon SRTP restart. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the repair:

1. **Identify the root cause**: The vulnerability occurs when the code incorrectly switches from SRTP to RTP upon SRTP restart, causing media to be sent insecurely. This happens when the `srtp->probation_cnt` is greater than 0 and the error is either `srtp_err_status_replay_old` or `srtp_err_status_replay_fail`.

2. **Stop SRTP before restarting**: To fix this issue, the code needs to ensure that SRTP is properly stopped before restarting it. This is done by calling `pjmedia_transport_srtp_stop` to stop the SRTP transport.

3. **Restart SRTP with the correct policies**: After stopping SRTP, the code needs to restart it with the correct policies. This is done by calling `pjmedia_transport_srtp_start` with the `tx` and `rx` policies.

4. **Check the restart status**: The code checks the status of the SRTP restart operation. If the restart fails, an error message is logged.

5. **Unprotect the packet only if SRTP is not bypassed**: If the SRTP restart is successful and SRTP is not bypassed, the code proceeds to unprotect the packet using `srtp_unprotect`.

The key change in the repair is the removal of the assignment of `tx` and `rx` policies before stopping SRTP. This ensures that the correct policies are used when restarting SRTP, preventing the incorrect switching to RTP.

By following these steps, the repair ensures that SRTP is properly restarted with the correct policies, preventing the vulnerability and maintaining the security of the media transport.
