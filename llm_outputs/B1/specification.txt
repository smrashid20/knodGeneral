Client Certificate:
This is the first message the client can send after receiving a ServerHelloDone message. This message is only sent if the server requests a certificate. If the client does not send any certificates, the server MAY at its discretion either continue the handshake without client authentication, or respond with a fatal handshake_failure alert. Also, if some aspect of the certificate chain was unacceptable (e.g., it was not signed by a known, trusted CA), the server MAY at its discretion either continue the handshake (considering the client unauthenticated) or send a fatal alert.

Client Key Exchange Message:
This message is always sent by the client. It MUST immediately follow the client certificate message, if it is sent. Otherwise, it MUST be the first message sent by the client after it receives the ServerHelloDone message.
When the client is using an ephemeral Diffie-Hellman exponent, then this message contains the client's Diffie-Hellman public value. If the client is sending a certificate containing a static DH exponent (i.e., it is doing fixed_dh client authentication), then this message MUST be sent but MUST be empty.

Certificate Verify:
This message is used to provide explicit verification of a client certificate. This message is only sent following a client certificate that has signing capability (i.e., all certificates except those containing fixed Diffie-Hellman parameters). When sent, it MUST immediately follow the client key exchange message.
