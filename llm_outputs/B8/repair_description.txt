The repair steps for the vulnerability in the wolfSSL code involve adding a sanity check to ensure that either a Pre-Shared Key (PSK) or a Key Share Extension (KSE) is present when a TLS 1.3 client connects to a server. Here are the steps to repair the vulnerability:

1. **Identify the vulnerable condition**: The vulnerability occurs when a TLS 1.3 client does not receive a PSK or KSE extension from the server, causing a default predictable buffer to be used for the Initial Keying Material (IKM) value. This compromises the security of the session master secret key.

2. **Locate the relevant code section**: The vulnerable code is located in the section that handles the server hello message. Specifically, it is in the part that checks for the presence of a PSK extension.

3. **Add a sanity check**: To repair the vulnerability, a sanity check is added to ensure that either a PSK or KSE is present. This check is performed after the PSK extension has been processed.

4. **Check for PSK or KSE presence**: The sanity check verifies that either the PSK has been negotiated (i.e., `ssl->options.pskNegotiated` is true) or a KSE is present (i.e., `ssl->session->namedGroup` is non-zero).

5. **Return an error if the check fails**: If the sanity check fails, indicating that neither a PSK nor KSE is present, the function returns an error code (`EXT_MISSING`). This prevents the TLS 1.3 session from proceeding with an insecure key.

6. **Ensure the fix does not affect other functionality**: The repair should not affect the client's validation of connected servers or expose private key information. The fix only addresses the specific vulnerability related to the use of a predictable IKM value when generating the session master secret key.

By adding this sanity check, the wolfSSL code ensures that a TLS 1.3 client will not proceed with an insecure session if a PSK or KSE is not present, thereby preventing potential eavesdropping or tampering with the session contents.
