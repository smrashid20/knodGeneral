To repair the vulnerability in the given code, the following steps can be taken:

1. **Identify the root cause of the vulnerability**: The vulnerability arises from the incorrect use of the revocationDate check when deciding whether to honor certificate revocation via a Certificate Revocation List (CRL). This check can be exploited by an attacker who can manipulate the local clock.

2. **Understand the purpose of the revocationDate check**: The revocationDate check is intended to verify whether a certificate has been revoked. However, in this case, it is being used in a way that can be exploited.

3. **Determine the correct approach**: To fix the vulnerability, the revocationDate check should be removed, as it is not necessary for the correct functioning of the code. The correct approach is to simply verify that the serial numbers of the certificates match.

4. **Remove the vulnerable code**: The line of code that checks if the current time is past the revocation date should be removed. This line is not necessary and is the source of the vulnerability.

5. **Verify the serial numbers**: The code should only verify that the serial numbers of the certificates match. This is a secure and necessary check to ensure that the certificates are valid.

6. **Test the repaired code**: Once the vulnerable code has been removed and the serial number check remains, the repaired code should be thoroughly tested to ensure that it functions correctly and does not introduce any new vulnerabilities.

7. **Deploy the repaired code**: After testing, the repaired code can be deployed, ensuring that the vulnerability is fixed and the code is secure.

By following these steps, the vulnerability in the given code can be successfully repaired, and the code can be made secure against potential attacks.
