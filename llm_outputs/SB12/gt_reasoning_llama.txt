The vulnerability in earlier versions of wolfSSL allows a malicious attacker with a privileged network position to impersonate TLS 1.3 servers and bypass authentication. This is due to the way the code handles signature algorithms and peer key presence during the TLS handshake.

In the buggy code, when the peer sends a signature algorithm that does not match the expected key type, the code only logs a message but does not take any further action. For example, if the peer sends an ED25519 signature algorithm but does not provide an ED25519 key, the code logs a message saying "Oops, peer sent ED25519 key but not in verify" but continues with the handshake.

The problem with this approach is that it allows an attacker to send a signature algorithm that is not supported by the peer's key, effectively bypassing authentication. This is because the code does not enforce a strict match between the signature algorithm and the peer's key type.

The repair addresses this vulnerability by introducing a stricter check between the signature algorithm and the peer's key type. If the peer sends a signature algorithm that does not match the expected key type, the code now returns an error, specifically `SIG_VERIFY_E` or `INVALID_PARAMETER`, depending on the signature algorithm.

For instance, if the peer sends an ED25519 signature algorithm but does not provide an ED25519 key, the code now returns `SIG_VERIFY_E` with a message saying "Peer sent ED25519 sig but not ED25519 cert". This ensures that the handshake is terminated immediately, preventing the attacker from bypassing authentication.

By introducing this stricter check, the repair ensures that the TLS handshake is more secure and resistant to man-in-the-middle attacks. The code now enforces a strict match between the signature algorithm and the peer's key type, preventing an attacker from sending a signature algorithm that is not supported by the peer's key.
