The repair steps for the vulnerability in the wolfSSL code involve several key changes to address the potential man-in-the-middle attack on TLS 1.3 clients. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1. **Improved Error Handling**: The first step is to enhance error handling for cases where the peer sends a signature algorithm that doesn't match the expected key type. Instead of just logging a message, the code now returns an error code (`SIG_VERIFY_E`) to indicate that the signature verification failed.

2. **Consistent Error Messages**: The error messages have been updated to be more descriptive and consistent across different signature algorithms. This helps with debugging and provides more informative error messages.

3. **Explicit Certificate Verification**: The code now explicitly checks if the peer's key is present in the verify buffer for each signature algorithm. This ensures that the peer's key is properly verified before proceeding with the signature verification.

4. **RSA Signature Algorithm Handling**: The code now correctly handles the RSA signature algorithm by checking if the peer's RSA key is present and if the signature algorithm matches the expected type (PKCS#1.5 or RSA-PSS).

5. **Early Exit on Error**: The code now uses a `goto` statement to exit the function early if any of the signature verification checks fail. This prevents the function from continuing with potentially invalid data.

6. **Consistent Return Codes**: The code now consistently returns an error code (`SIG_VERIFY_E`) for all signature verification failures, making it easier to handle errors in the calling code.

7. **Removal of Redundant Code**: The code has been simplified by removing redundant checks and messages, making it more concise and easier to maintain.

By implementing these changes, the repaired code provides improved security against man-in-the-middle attacks on TLS 1.3 clients by ensuring that the peer's key is properly verified before proceeding with signature verification.
