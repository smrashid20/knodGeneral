To repair the OpenSSL vulnerability, the following steps were taken:

1. **Identify the root cause**: The vulnerability was identified as a failure to properly restrict processing of ChangeCipherSpec (CCS) messages, which allowed man-in-the-middle attackers to trigger the use of a zero-length master key. This was happening because the CCS_OK flag was not being set correctly.

2. **Locate the affected code**: The affected code was located in the handshake state machine, specifically in the SSL3_ST_CR_FINISHED_A and SSL3_ST_CR_FINISHED_B states.

3. **Analyze the existing code**: The existing code was analyzed to understand the logic and the flow of the handshake state machine. It was found that the CCS_OK flag was not being set explicitly in the affected states.

4. **Determine the fix**: To fix the vulnerability, it was determined that the CCS_OK flag should be set explicitly in the affected states to prevent the use of a zero-length master key.

5. **Implement the fix**: The fix was implemented by adding a line of code to set the CCS_OK flag in the affected states. This ensures that the flag is set before the handshake state is updated to SSL_ST_OK.

6. **Verify the fix**: The fix was verified by testing the handshake state machine with various scenarios to ensure that the CCS_OK flag is set correctly and that the vulnerability is no longer exploitable.

7. **Test for regressions**: The fix was also tested for regressions to ensure that it does not introduce any new issues or break existing functionality.

By following these steps, the OpenSSL vulnerability was successfully repaired, and the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks triggering the use of a zero-length master key was mitigated.
