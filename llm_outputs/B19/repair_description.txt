The repair steps for the given vulnerability involve modifying the TLS driver to disable support for SSLv2 and weak SSL ciphers, making it more secure against brute-force attacks. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the repair:

1. **Identify the vulnerable code**: The first step is to identify the code that is vulnerable to the attack. In this case, it's the TLS driver that supports SSLv2 and weak SSL ciphers.

2. **Disable SSLv2 support**: The next step is to disable support for SSLv2, which is a known insecure protocol. This is done by setting the SSL options to exclude SSLv2.

3. **Specify a secure cipher list**: To prevent the use of weak SSL ciphers, a secure cipher list should be specified. This list should include only strong and secure ciphers that are resistant to brute-force attacks.

4. **Verify the changes**: After making the changes, it's essential to verify that the TLS driver is no longer vulnerable to the attack. This can be done by testing the driver with various tools and techniques to ensure that it's secure.

5. **Test for compatibility**: Once the changes are verified, it's crucial to test the TLS driver for compatibility with various clients and servers. This ensures that the changes haven't introduced any compatibility issues.

6. **Deploy the patch**: Finally, the patched TLS driver should be deployed to all affected systems, and the changes should be thoroughly tested in a production environment.

By following these steps, the TLS driver can be secured against brute-force attacks, and the vulnerability can be effectively repaired. The repair involves a combination of disabling insecure protocols, specifying secure ciphers, and verifying the changes to ensure the driver's security and compatibility.
