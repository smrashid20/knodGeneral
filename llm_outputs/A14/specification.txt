The change cipher spec protocol exists to signal transitions in ciphering strategies. The ChangeCipherSpec message is sent during the handshake after the security parameters have been agreed upon, but before the verifying Finished message is sent.
Following the hello messages, the server will send its certificate in a Certificate message if it is to be authenticated. Additionally, a ServerKeyExchange message may be sent, if it is required. Next, the server will send the ServerHelloDone message, indicating that the hello-message phase of the handshake is complete. The server will then wait for a client response. If the server has sent a CertificateRequest message, the client MUST send the Certificate message. The ClientKeyExchange message is now sent, and the content of that message will depend on the public key algorithm selected between the ClientHello and the ServerHello. If the client has sent a certificate with signing ability, a digitally-signed CertificateVerify message is sent to explicitly verify possession of the private key in the certificate. At this point, a ChangeCipherSpec message is sent by the client, and the client copies the pending Cipher Spec into the current Cipher Spec. The client then immediately sends the Finished message under the new algorithms, keys, and secrets. In response, the server will send its own ChangeCipherSpec message, transfer the pending to the current Cipher Spec, and send its Finished message under the new Cipher Spec. It is essential that a change cipher spec message be received between the other handshake messages and the Finished message.
