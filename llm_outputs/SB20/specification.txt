STARTTLS Command
In order to begin the STARTTLS negotiation, the initiating entity issues the STARTTLS command (i.e., a <starttls/> element qualified by the 'urn\:ietf\:params\:xml\:ns\:xmpp-tls' namespace) to instruct the receiving entity that it wishes to begin a STARTTLS negotiation to secure the stream.

The receiving entity MUST reply with either a <proceed/> element (proceed case) or a <failure/> element (failure case) qualified by the 'urn\:ietf\:params\:xml\:ns\:xmpp-tls' namespace.

Failure Case
If the failure case occurs, the receiving entity MUST return a <failure/> element qualified by the 'urn\:ietf\:params\:xml\:ns\:xmpp-tls' namespace, close the XML stream, and terminate the underlying TCP connection.

Causes for the failure case include but are not limited to:

1. The initiating entity has sent a malformed STARTTLS command.
2. The receiving entity did not offer the STARTTLS feature in its stream features.
3. The receiving entity cannot complete STARTTLS negotiation because of an internal error.

Informational Note: STARTTLS failure is not triggered by TLS errors such as bad\_certificate or handshake\_failure, which are generated and handled during the TLS negotiation itself as described in \[TLS].

If the failure case occurs, the initiating entity MAY attempt to reconnect.
