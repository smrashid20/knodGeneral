The vulnerability in the OpenSSL library arises from the mishandling of a negative return value from the X509_verify_cert() function. This function is used to verify a certificate supplied by a server on the client side. When an internal error occurs, such as running out of memory, X509_verify_cert() returns a negative value. However, this negative return value is not properly handled by OpenSSL, leading to unexpected behavior in applications.

The issue lies in the fact that the negative return value causes an IO function, like SSL_connect() or SSL_do_handshake(), to not indicate success. Subsequently, a call to SSL_get_error() returns the value SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY. This return value is only intended to be used when an application has previously set a custom verification callback using SSL_CTX_set_cert_verify_callback(). However, most applications do not set this callback, resulting in an unexpected return value that may cause the application to behave incorrectly.

The repair addresses this issue by adding a simple check for the return value of X509_STORE_CTX.verify_cert(ctxStore). If the return value is negative, it is explicitly set to 0, indicating success. This ensures that the IO function will correctly indicate success, and the subsequent call to SSL_get_error() will not return the unexpected SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY value.

By making this change, the repair prevents the unexpected behavior that may occur when an internal error happens during certificate verification. This fix ensures that applications will behave correctly even when an error occurs, as the return value will be properly handled and not misinterpreted. The repair is a straightforward solution that mitigates the vulnerability and prevents potential issues in applications that rely on the OpenSSL library.
