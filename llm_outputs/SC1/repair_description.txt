To repair the vulnerability in the OpenSSL code, several steps need to be taken. 

First, the root cause of the issue needs to be identified, which is the mishandling of a negative return value from the X509_verify_cert function. This function is used to verify a certificate supplied by a server, and a negative return value indicates an internal error, such as running out of memory.

Next, the conditions under which this error occurs need to be understood. The error happens when the application has not set a custom verification callback using the SSL_CTX_set_cert_verify_callback function. In this case, the SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY return value from the SSL_get_error function is unexpected and may cause the application to behave incorrectly.

To fix this issue, a check needs to be added to handle the negative return value from the X509_verify_cert function. This check should be performed when the application has not set a custom verification callback.

The repair involves adding a conditional statement to check if the return value from the X509_verify_cert function is negative. If it is, the return value should be set to 0, indicating that the verification was successful. This ensures that the SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY return value is not returned unexpectedly, preventing potential issues with the application's behavior.

By adding this simple check, the vulnerability in the OpenSSL code can be fixed, and the code can be made more robust and reliable. This repair is a straightforward solution that addresses the root cause of the issue and prevents potential problems with the application's behavior.
