The vulnerability in question arises from the mishandling of X.509 certificate verification, specifically when matching the expected common name with the actual certificate name. The issue occurs when the subjectAltName extension is present in the certificate. In such cases, the expected name is compared to any name in that extension, regardless of its type. This oversight allows an attacker to potentially impersonate a domain by obtaining a certificate for the corresponding IPv4 or IPv6 address, provided they control that IP address.

The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the use of the `x509_crt_check_cn` function, which only checks the common name (CN) field of the certificate. However, when the subjectAltName extension is present, the CN field is not the only field that should be considered. The subjectAltName extension can contain multiple names, including DNS names, IP addresses, and email addresses, each with its own specific type.

The repair addresses this issue by replacing the `x509_crt_check_cn` function with the `x509_crt_check_san` function. The `x509_crt_check_san` function is designed to check the subjectAltName extension of the certificate, which is a more comprehensive approach. By using this function, the verification process will correctly handle certificates with the subjectAltName extension, ensuring that the expected name is matched against the correct type of name in the extension.

In essence, the repair ensures that the verification process is more robust and accurate, preventing an attacker from exploiting the vulnerability by obtaining a certificate for an IP address and impersonating a domain. By checking the subjectAltName extension, the repair provides an additional layer of security, making it more difficult for attackers to manipulate the certificate verification process.
