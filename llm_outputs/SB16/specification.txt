A resolver implementation MUST match responses to all of the following attributes of the query:

* Source address against query destination address
* Destination address against query source address
* Destination port against query source port
* Query ID
* Query name
* Query class and type

before applying DNS trustworthiness rules.

A mismatch and the response MUST be considered invalid.
