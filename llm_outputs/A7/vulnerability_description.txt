The X509_verify_cert function in crypto/x509/x509_vfy.c in OpenSSL does not properly process X.509 Basic Constraints cA values during identification of alternative certificate chains, which allows remote attackers to spoof a Certification Authority role and trigger unintended certificate verifications via a valid leaf certificate.
