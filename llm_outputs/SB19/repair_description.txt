The repair steps for the given vulnerability involve several modifications to the TLS driver code to enhance its security. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the changes made:

1. **Upgrade the SSL protocol version**: The first change is to upgrade the SSL protocol version from SSLv23_METHOD to TLS. This is done to ensure that the TLS driver uses the more secure Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol instead of the older Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.

2. **Disable SSLv2 and SSLv3**: In addition to upgrading the protocol version, the repair also explicitly disables SSLv2 and SSLv3. This is done by setting the SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2 and SSL_OP_NO_SSLv3 options, which prevents the TLS driver from using these insecure protocols.

3. **Disable weak ciphers**: The repair also disables weak ciphers by setting the SSL_OP_NO_TICKET option and configuring a cipher list that excludes weak ciphers. The cipher list is set to "HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5:!RC4", which means that only high-strength ciphers are allowed, and ciphers that use anonymous authentication (aNULL), MD5, or RC4 are excluded.

4. **Maintain other security settings**: The repair maintains other security settings, such as disabling session caching, setting default verification paths, and verifying the peer and client certificates. These settings ensure that the TLS driver continues to enforce secure connections.

5. **Update error handling**: The repair also updates error handling to ensure that any errors that occur during the TLS setup process are properly handled and reported.

By implementing these changes, the repair ensures that the TLS driver uses a more secure protocol version, disables weak ciphers, and maintains other security settings to prevent brute-force attacks and protect sensitive information.
